Our project's goal is the extraction of biological priors from neuronal skeletons for eventual classification of cell type. The script we produced takes .swc files (we used NeuroMorpho.org to download neuronal skeletons of interest, specifically granule and pyramidal cells from the rat hippocampus from the Turner Lab) and outputs information on branching angle, branch length, path length, branch order, number of tips, and number of branches. Specifically, the script outputs:
- mean and standard deviation
- overlaying plots using the kernal smoothing function estimate
- the statistical difference using the Hellinger distance

To run the MATLAB script, first download the TREES toolbox.
Next, organize your two groups of trees into different folder.
Run the first two sections each in a different folder of trees.
